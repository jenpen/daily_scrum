# Daily Scrum
Web application creating daily scrum boards for use across project sprint. 

##Summary:

Daily Scrum solves the problem of having remote teams needing a central board to look at for daily scrums. It allows team members to create note cards for daily scrum meeting over the course of a project sprint. Users answer three questions each day. 
* What did I accomplish yesterday? 
* What am I working on today? 
* What are the roadblocks?
