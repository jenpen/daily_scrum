# Rubric
## Project Workflow
Exceeds expectations. Your planning folder and particularly your readme doc are exceptional. It is evident in your application that many methodical planning steps were taken to create this application. Great work! Trello! :+1:

## Technical Requirements
Meets expectations. Really great work on this project. It is very evident you have an extremely strong foundation in all of the concepts covered in Unit 2. Really happy how your project turned out. I would encourage you to finish out some of those icebox features and flesh out commenting.

## Code Quality
Meets expectations. Code is well indented. HOWEVER! There is a lacking of comments in your code! Please make sure to comment any tricky parts of code you encounter or had trouble with. Future jen will be much happier.

## Deployment and Functionality
Meets expectations. The site is deployed to heroku and looks amazing. All the functionality seems to be working fluidly with few, if any, bugs. (haven't seen any yet.)

## Overall
Really wonderful job on this project jen. Though you see many meets expectations, I really think this project warrants more than that because of just how polished it is. One of the more polished projects of the entire class. It's one thing for people to be ambitious and set goals with random external dependencies. But you'll notice that many of them that did that did not have a "complete" product. I think you do. Great work!
